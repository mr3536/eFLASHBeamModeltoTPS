# eFLASH Beam Model to TPS

Here is a configured beam model and configuration into a treatment planning software (Eclipse, Varian) of an electron ultra high dose rate (>40GY/s) FLASH irradiator from a modified linear accelerator (Varian CLINAC 2100 C/D) utilizing clinical acessories and geometry. The modifications are described in doi:10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.01.011. The GAMOS produced and confirmed model is included in the file "GAMOS_Beam_Model_100cmSSD". The GAMOS MC simulations for a mouse brain treatement and deliver in a water phantom for validation are included in "GAMOS_Mouse_Treatment_Example". "Run_Code.txt" provides the few lines of code inputed to terminal to run the simualtion with the brain treatment as an example. The GAMOS simulation to produce Eclipse and the Eclipse input files for the beam model are included in the file "Eclipse". 

The details and development of the model and configuration into the clinical treatment planning software can be found in: Rahman M, Ashraf MR, Gladstone DJ, Bruza P, Cao X, Pogue BW, Hoopes PJ, Zhang R. Clinical Treatment Planning System for Electron FLASH Radiotherapy. In Preparation.
